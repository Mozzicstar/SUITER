SUITER Demo Instructions

1) Start services

- API (mock server):
  In a terminal run:
    python3 api_mock.py
  This initializes the sample DB and starts the API on http://localhost:3000

- Frontend (static):
  In a second terminal run:
    ./frontend/server.sh 8080
  Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

- Optional: Live demo on GitHub Pages
  Visit:
    https://Mozzicstar.github.io/SUITER
  This hosted site uses embedded mock data so you can view the demo without running the API locally.

2) Walkthrough script (what to show and where to click)

- Landing view:
  • Point out the header and the LIVE status badge.
  • Show the Network stats widget: Total Posts and Ranked (sidebar).

- Top Trending (sidebar):
  • Explain it displays **author + short content snippet** for each trending post.
  • Click a top-post item — the feed will automatically scroll to the corresponding post and it will be highlighted briefly. Demonstrate click → scroll → highlight.

- Feed (main area):
  • Show posts (author, human-friendly timestamp, content, engagement numbers).
  • Point out the level/reputation badge and attention metric.

- Rankings tab:
  • Click the 🏆 Rankings tab and explain how profiles are ranked (score = reputation + attention in the mock).

- Create a post (live demo):
  • In Share Truth form (sidebar) set Author (optional) and add content in "What's on your mind?".
  • Click **Post** (or press Ctrl+Enter) to submit. Mention the toast notification (success/failure).
  • The new post should appear at the top of the feed after submission.

- Debug panel (optional):
  • Open bottom-right debug panel to show real-time log messages for API fetch attempts and actions.

3) Talking points

- The mock server uses realistic sample posts and derives engagement metrics to look plausible.
- The Top Trending list is now readable and actionable (click → navigate to post) for demos.
- Creating a post updates the feed and profiles to show changes in the rankings and stats.

4) Optional follow-ups to enhance the demo

- Add a detailed post modal when clicking a top post (show full text, comments, and share options).
- Add images or embeds to posts to demonstrate richer content.
- Make snippet generation smarter (highlight important sentences or keywords).
