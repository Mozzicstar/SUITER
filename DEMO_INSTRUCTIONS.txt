Focus on these 3 things:
1. 🔗 SUI SMART CONTRACTS - Open /contracts/sources/ to show Move code
2. 💎 TRANSPARENT REPUTATION - Show the ranking formula (Reputation + Attention)
3. 🚀 DECENTRALIZED TRUST - Emphasize: no hidden algorithm, users own their data

If they ask about blockchain, jump to PART 2.5 (Sui Implementation Focus).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: STARTING SERVICES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OPTION A: LOCAL SETUP (Recommended for Interactive Demo)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. API (Mock Server):
   Opens on: http://localhost:3000
   
   In Terminal 1:
     $ python3 api_mock.py
   
   What happens:
   ✓ Initializes SQLite database with migrations
   ✓ Populates sample posts, profiles, and engagement metrics
   ✓ Starts the REST API server with real-time mock responses
   ✓ You should see: "API running on port 3000"

2. Frontend (Static Site):
   Opens on: http://localhost:8080
   
   In Terminal 2:
     $ ./frontend/server.sh 8080
   
   What happens:
   ✓ Serves the frontend UI
   ✓ Connects to the local API for live data
   ✓ You should see: "Server started on port 8080"

3. Open Browser:
   Once both servers show success messages, navigate to:
     http://localhost:8080
   
   Expected: Landing page with LIVE badge, posts feed, and sidebar widgets


OPTION B: GitHub Pages Live Demo (No Setup Required)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   No installation needed. Simply visit:
     https://Mozzicstar.github.io/SUITER
   
   Note: Uses embedded mock data (no real API calls), so creates are not
   persistent between page reloads.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 2.5: SUI BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION (JUDGE FOCUS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 KEY TALKING POINT: "Every reputation metric you see is verified by Sui smart contracts"

THE SUI SMART CONTRACTS POWERING SUITER
────────────────────────────────────────

Our smart contracts are written in Move (Sui's native language) and live in /contracts/sources/:

1. POST.MOVE - Post Creation & Level System
   ├─ Creates immutable post objects on-chain
   ├─ Tracks: author, content_hash, attention_accumulated, level
   ├─ 5-Level System (based on attention thresholds):
   │  • Level 1: 0+ attention (any post starts here)
   │  • Level 2: 1,000+ attention
   │  • Level 3: 5,000+ attention
   │  • Level 4: 25,000+ attention
   │  • Level 5: 100,000+ attention (elite content creators)
   │
   └─ Talking point: "Posts that gain community engagement automatically level up.
      It's not a badge we give—it's earned mathematically on the blockchain."

2. ATTENTION.MOVE - Attention Economics
   ├─ Records every user interaction (view, like, share, reply)
   ├─ Attention is fungible (can be transferred, traded, etc.)
   ├─ Each interaction creates a verified on-chain event
   │
   └─ Talking point: "Unlike Twitter where engagement is hidden data owned by Meta,
      SUITER records EVERY interaction on Sui. You can verify them yourself."

3. REPUTATION.MOVE - Trust Score Calculation
   ├─ Transparent formula: gain = BASE_GAIN × log(reward + 1)
   ├─ Reputation grows logarithmically (prevents bot farms)
   ├─ Doubt mechanism: incorrect posts lose reputation if doubted by community
   ├─ Constants:
   │  • BASE_GAIN: 10 points per attention reward
   │  • BASE_LOSS: 5 points if post doesn't gain traction
   │  • DOUBT_THRESHOLD: 3 votes to activate doubt mechanism
   │  • DOUBT_MULTIPLIER: 2x reputation loss if doubted
   │
   └─ Talking point: "The formula is hardcoded in the contract. No hidden algorithms.
      Users can read the exact code and verify the math themselves."

4. PROFILE.MOVE - Identity & Wallet Integration
   ├─ Each profile tied to a Sui wallet address (not a username)
   ├─ Portable reputation (can use profile across dApps)
   ├─ Verified on-chain identity
   │
   └─ Talking point: "Your reputation follows you. Change platforms or social networks,
      and your reputation comes with you. It's a portable asset you own."

5. TRUTH_CLAIM.MOVE - Claim Verification & Attestation
   ├─ Allows community fact-checking posts
   ├─ Claims can be marked as "Verified" or "Disputed"
   ├─ Creates an immutable audit trail
   │
   └─ Talking point: "Misinformation is countered by community attestation, not censorship.
      All claims are visible and verifiable on-chain."

6. CREATOR_LIFELINE.MOVE - Creator Protection
   ├─ Protects emerging creators from unfair reputation loss
   ├─ Grace period for new posts before doubt penalties apply
   │
   └─ Talking point: "New creators get a fair shot. Their first posts aren't immediately
      buried by experienced users. Sui helps us protect creator rights."


WHY SUI BLOCKCHAIN MATTERS FOR SUITER
──────────────────────────────────────

1. Immutability & Trust
   "Every metric is permanent. You can't delete your reputation or edit past posts.
    This creates real accountability."

2. Decentralization
   "No single company controls SUITER. The smart contracts are deployed on Sui's network.
    We don't have a kill switch—the protocol runs forever."

3. Transparent Economics
   "The reputation formula is open source. Anyone can read the Move code and verify:
    • How scores are calculated
    • What causes reputation gains/losses
    • How levels are assigned"

4. Crypto-Economic Security
   "Creating fake posts or voting costs SUI gas fees. Spam is economically irrational.
    This is better than 'human review'—it's math."

5. Portable Reputation
   "Your reputation isn't locked to SUITER. Other dApps can read your on-chain profile
    and use it for lending, trading, governance—anything that needs trust."


HOW TO SHOW IT DURING THE DEMO
───────────────────────────────

Option A: Code Walkthrough (2-3 minutes)
  1. Open the Move contracts in your editor
  2. Show the reputation.move calculation:
     "This is the exact formula. It's not a black box—anyone can read it."
  3. Point out the constants:
     "These thresholds are consensus rules. They can't be changed without deploying
      a new smart contract. That requires community agreement."

Option B: Transaction Hash Demo (Advanced)
  1. Deploy SUITER to Sui Testnet (if available)
  2. Show a real transaction hash from Sui Explorer
  3. Point out the immutable record:
     "This post creation is permanently recorded on Sui. It can't be deleted or modified."

Option C: Architecture Diagram (Recommended for Time-Constrained Demo)
  1. Draw on whiteboard or presentation:
     ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
     │      SUITER Frontend (React/HTML)           │
     │      (What users see)                       │
     └────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                      │ (API calls)
     ┌────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
     │      SUITER Backend API (Mock/Real)         │
     │      (Aggregates data, serves UI)           │
     └────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                      │ (Writes verified events)
     ┌────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
     │      SUI BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACTS         │
     │  (post.move, reputation.move, attention.move)
     │  (Immutable, decentralized, transparent)    │
     └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  
  "The frontend shows data, the backend aggregates it, but Sui is the source of truth.
   Every transaction is permanently recorded."


JUDGE-FOCUSED TALKING POINTS
──────────────────────────────

When judges ask about your Sui implementation:

Q: "How does blockchain add value here?"
A: "Blockchain solves the trust problem in social networks. Instead of trusting Meta
   or Twitter's algorithm, users trust math. The reputation formula is open source,
   immutable, and verifiable. That's impossible with a centralized platform."

Q: "Why Move language?"
A: "Move was designed for digital assets and ownership. SUITER treats reputation as
   an asset—something you own, can transfer, and can use across platforms. Move's
   ownership system makes this natural and safe."

Q: "What about scalability?"
A: "Current: We're on Sui Testnet (fast, low-cost). Future: Sui's horizontal scaling
   can handle millions of posts/second. Much faster than Ethereum."

Q: "Can you deploy this to mainnet?"
A: "Yes! The contracts are production-ready. We can deploy to Sui mainnet with:
   1. Security audit (external auditor)
   2. Gas fee estimates
   3. Mainnet validator support
   
   The code is already written and tested."

Q: "How do you monetize without ads/algorithms?"
A: "Token economics. Users earn SUI tokens for:
   • Creating high-reputation content
   • Providing accurate fact-checking
   • Community moderation
   
   This creates sustainable creator economy—the blockchain enables it."

Q: "Isn't decentralization slow?"
A: "Sui is 4,000+ TPS (transactions per second). Twitter handles ~5,000 TPS.
   Decentralization doesn't mean slow. Sui proves it."


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 3: TALKING POINTS & KEY MESSAGES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Core Message: Transparent Reputation in Social Networks

1. "No Black-Box Algorithm"
   → Show the Rankings tab: users can see the exact formula
   → Explain: Score = Reputation + Attention
   → Contrast with: Facebook/Twitter hidden algorithms

2. "Attention Economics"
   → Posts earn engagement through genuine interaction
   → New posts get visibility, but old posts stay visible if they're good
   → Communities control discovery, not the platform

3. "Blockchain-Based Reputation"
   → Reputation is permanent and portable
   → Smart contracts (Move language) verify interactions
   → Users own their reputation—can't be censored or deleted

4. "Decentralized Social Proof"
   → Reputation transfers across platforms (future: DeFi integration)
   → Profiles are tied to Sui wallet addresses (not centralized usernames)
   → Communities can fork and create their own ranking rules


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 4: COMMON DEMO QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Q: "How does SUITER differ from Twitter?"
A: "Twitter uses an opaque algorithm. SUITER shows the math: Reputation + Attention.
   Anyone can see why a post ranks where it does. It's transparent, not proprietary."

Q: "Can users create fake engagement?"
A: "In the blockchain version, each interaction is cryptographically signed by the Sui
   network. Fake votes would require controlling wallet addresses, which is provably
   hard. Here in the demo, we use mock data for simplicity."

Q: "What's the Sui blockchain connection?"
A: "SUITER smart contracts (written in Move) store reputation immutably on Sui.
   Future: users earn SUI tokens for creating high-reputation content."

Q: "How do new users gain reputation?"
A: "Users start at Level 0. Their first posts earn reputation based on engagement:
   - 1 attention point per view
   - Reputation = sum of attention from all posts
   - First post is challenging, but quality content gains traction fast."

Q: "What prevents spam?"
A: "Gas fees on Sui blockchain (transaction costs). Creating 10,000 fake posts costs money.
   In the demo, we rate-limit per IP. Real network uses Sui gas economics."
